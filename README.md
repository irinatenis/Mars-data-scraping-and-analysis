## **Deliverables**:

- Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
## **Tools**:

- Extracted an HTML table into a Pandas DataFrame.
- The data was analyzed to answer the following questions:

1. *How many months exist on Mars?*
2. *How many Martian days' worth of data are there?* 

- The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer: 

1. *Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?*
2. *Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?* 
3. *How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made.*
4. *The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file.*
